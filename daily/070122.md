# 7th January 2022

This morning I had my first "Space Debris Office Morning Coffee": [Naval](https://twitter.com/naval) says that meetings kill productivity. I would argue that loneliness is much worse, at least for me. At work I managed to work on nested CMake projects, with Pybind11 and our command line interface, I will need to figure out how to use external dependencies in Pybind11 when the package is installed with pip directly from the requirements of our package. After work I've recorded [this dorian solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X96IDktr804) from when I was studying guitar. I've then met with Daniele, we first discussed field theory, gauge fixing (I am struggling with these) and then Koopman theory, time-delay embedding and fractional calculus. The hope is to find common ground, I am sure somewhere there is. I have then watched [Louis CK's last special](https://louisck.com/products/sorry) with Leonardo and worked a bit on my website before closing the day.
