I won't break the chain, but fuck, this is hard.

This morning Stefano helped me give a meaning to this working day. We sent some email, collected some literature, discussed some research ideas that we hope to push forward together.

As I don't have much more to say about the day, I will put down some things I thought months ago.

The success of Squid Game is in line with the Peter Thiel argument about lack of growth in the West: because it feels like the majority of us are stuck in zero sum games, and that rich people are much more focused on value estraction than value creation (see this [work](https://marianamazzucato.com/books/the-value-of-everything) by Mariana Mazzucato), people are attracted by a narration bringing this idea to the extremes.

A good story about the implications of only playing zero-sum games is [The Bottle Imp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bottle_Imp), by Stevenson. Squid Game is like the opposite, in the sense that only one super lucky person is balanced by many not-so-lucky. In Stevenson many relatively lucky person are balanced by one cursed. In both cases the net value of the endavour is conserved. This is a tragedy, regardless of how things are distributed among players.

Let's play zero-sum games, status games as Naval calls them, as little as possible. The alternative can't necessarily be much different from [Sal√≤](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal%C3%B2,_or_the_120_Days_of_Sodom).
