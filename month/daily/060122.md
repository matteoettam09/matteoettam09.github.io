# 6th January 2022

During the last few days I've been struggling again with insomnia, sleep paralysis, palpitations, panic attacks, lack of appetite. Could journaling help me? This morning I struggled to get up from bed, but around 2pm I managed to eat something. I had to go back to bed because of headache, but I was eventually able to have a working meeting at 4.30pm. My current working environment is nice, I like interating with the people in IMS. The pandemic is however still here: I used to be much more productive and satistifed with my level of engagement with my work before February 2020. Doing software engineering alone in my studio flat can be alienating, but I am payed to do it and I need to do it well. In some sense what I am fighting with now is the manifestation of a global problem in my life. I had an exchange with people at [Kayhan Space](https://www.kayhan.space/), really interesting company to be further explored. I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuVFcJYkkro) lecture by prof. Giorgio Parisi. I would like to read "Perturbative Theory without Gauge fixing", "On the multifractal nature of fully developed turbulence and chaotic systems" and "Complex Systems: a Physicistâ€™s Viewpoint". I think a discussion with Roberto Benzi would also be interesting: I've been reading his stochastic resonance works for a couple of years now.
