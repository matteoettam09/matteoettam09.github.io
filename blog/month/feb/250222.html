# 25th February 2022

I worked, but not much, cause I am not feeling good. Not sure if it's Covid, if it's isolation, if it's the war.
I will work more on the weekend.

This evening I wrote [this](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6903071873467236353/). And then I wrote [them](https://scale.com/blog/ukraine-detection)
And I can say many things about the bravery of soldiers dying as heroes. The "fuck you Russians" guys, the guy that
blow up the bridge and died to do so, and many others.

But I think I have a problem: that when I am not ok I look for problems to solve outside myself. This is not sustainable.
I am torturing myself in this way, I need to take care of the world, and of myself, despite the world out there, despite
the tragic aspects of reality. Revenge is not good not only for its consequences, but because it makes you a beast in the process.

Make me be good and balanced.
