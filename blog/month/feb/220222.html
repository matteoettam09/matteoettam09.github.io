# 22nd February 2022

I felt sick cause I had Covid. I have Covid. I couldn't work for the last few days. I think I am alone in this world.
There is no chance of finding true satisfaction in this world. My idea of paying people to work with me started from the
assumption that people already wanted to spend time studying and understanding things, and that my payment was an incentive to
do that with me, instead of on their own. I was wrong, people don't have this urge that I have to understand the world.
So I could say fuck them for not being with me. But the mistake was mine. That's why today I am back to talk with you.
Let me also say that I don't care what happens to my notes, writings, songs, codes...I produce them because I like the production process,
not because I want to build a system in this world. The buddist Mandala is a good example of this. I know everything will be destroyed, I don't care.
You don't dance to destroy death, you dance because while you are dancing death doesn't manifest itself in the moment.
Also, as Louis CK says talking about Carlin, he was a creative force because he destroyed his production as soon as it was used. Fuck it.

It's me and you again, dear website. And in saying this palpitations go away.

I need my tennis racket, I want to play again. I want to win, I like playing.
I also like chess, maybe I should find a place in which people play it here in Bologna.

Cause also, my will to delegate came from the fact that I didn't have time to do everything I wanted. But that's an illusion, you cannot
delegate performing things you like and hope to get pleasure out of it.

You can delegate doing things you hate, but you cannot pay people to have an allignment of interests and goals like you.
And if they don't and you think you interests are alligned with reality, fuck them, get rich and enjoy life doing what you like
(which could be something meaningful for others, but that's a side effect, I don't care).

I care about doing things I like for the sake of it. [Carmelo Bene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN1HFU78yXA) lives.
Non e' la volonta' di assatanamento di potere la volonta' di potenza, ma e' il disfacimento del concetto di soggetto. L'arte deve essere incomunicabile.
L'arte deve solamente superare se stessa. Non posso che cercare di spiegare il mio disagio, non altro. Non posso dare appuntamenti con il reale.
Appuntamenti con l'ovvio, con il razionale.
