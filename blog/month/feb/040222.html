# 04th February 2022

This morning I joined again the SDO coffee. Two days that I wake up early, two productive, happy and balanced days.

I bought something for my home office and rearranged some things to make the enviroment more discipline-friendly. "L'essere e' laddove produce effetti": that which is, is wherever it produces effects. You are not the body you inhabit, and you are not your house, but actually you are both.

I worked again on the refactoring, this time in higher terms, I start seeing the global picture, the end goal of this part of the work, so it's easier. Also things are starting to look good, so it's easier to move forward.


Then nothing fancy, I had a call with Kevin at 6pm, let's see if we can do something about minor bodies exploration, UQ, optimal control, estimation, and how to make autonomous space missions more accessible. Gold is there waiting for us.

At 10pm I met with Benjamin: I am stupid. He got two big mistakes in my derivation, nice job. We should be careful with the finished work: the community will destroy us if we present something bad. So let's be quick but careful. It's amost midnight and I've been hard coding some high-dimensional symbolic tensors to play with. Wish me luck, ciao.
