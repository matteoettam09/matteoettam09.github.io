# 09th February 2022

First day back to the grind. Before starting to work I had to do some hosekeeping, both physically and in my schedule. Maybe more tiring than actual work, but important nonetheless.

For work I kept refactoring, mainly working on the oldest functionality of sdocoralib. I have also looked into the godot dependency, and for this met for the first time with Frazer, which seems a really strong software developer, and also has a view into the goals of the space debris office, it seems.

Before then end of the working day, I met with Volker and asked a few questions about the final goal of refactoring.

At 6pm I met with Benjamin: we re-derived the correct version of Ito's lemma for the linear case, but we still need to finish the general one. And I have to say I am a bit lost at this point, but we have time.

At 7pm I met with aerisgate, because of the vaccine I didn't do anything this week, but at least we talked about the work planned for the next few weeks, when Francesco will not be available.

Even if really tired, I managed to work on the podcast schedule for tomorrow's interview. I will now go get a beer, bye.
