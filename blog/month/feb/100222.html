# 10th February 2022

Steffen is on leave, so I decided not to work today and work on Saturday. This both because I was really tired yesterday and
because we'll get the merge request in godot hopefully done by the end of the week (but mainly because I was tired).

I basically started the day in the afternoon setting up the trading bot for a new client. I think I have also solved a long lasting issue.

I recorded the inverview with Yves Hilpisch, he gave me an idea about combining Reinforcement Learning with stochastic models.
Not sure if this is too much, but at least doing optimal control with a model (not forecasting, different approach) sounds reasonable.
He thinks cryptocurrency are a bubble, I don't, but only to a certain extent. But I cannot argue why: for sure asteroid mining
will make the scarcity gold assumption collapse. And the network effect idea seems reasonable. But I need to study more.

Neverthless, I agree with him that NFT's don't make sense. But in the same way, I don't think the paintings by Leonardo are worth more than a copy,
so I am not getting them as I was not getting art, and I may be wrong.

With the crypto guys we discussed my results with Daniele, some works on HMM and again critical transitions.

At 8pm I quickly met with Andrei, good codes, I now need to work a bit on a new branch, let's see if I can this weekend.

I have also twitted [this](https://twitter.com/Matteomanzi09/status/1491906342289879043). People really don't understand
what science and predictibility mean now. We need to educate people, and we can only do it studying ourselves.
