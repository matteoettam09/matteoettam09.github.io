# 03rd February 2022

Before work I booked the covid booster: fuck the pandemic.

After the SDO coffee I worked a bit, then we had the daily: our supervisor will join us more rarely. I don't blame him, it's the consequence of the fact I am not as productive as they expected, but in this realization I came to understand that I actually enjoy software development, so today was I productive refactoring day. We'll have to go back to the cpp dependencies because of the runtime results of Steffen, but I think I am ready. The next 10 days are for me to prove myself I can do what they want me to do. Then the work with Aerisgate will be much easier.

At 6pm I met with Stefano, we looked into Julia and Polynomial Chaos Expension, nothing fancy.

At 7pm crypto meeting, also with an external person: the meeting could have been an email, but ok.

At 8pm call with Andrei, his questions on point made me realize what we are aiming at is not so innovative, but it's not useless, so it's ok.

After dinner I ordered an office chair, time to arrange the things around me so that the fact that I am a software engineer is clearer.

Also, I've just finished working on Ito's lemma for Benjamin, I got an unexpected result but I think this doens't break our logic, if something makes the equations easier.
