# 28th February 2022

I worked 13.5 hours today. It's 3.08 am, and I am no longer positive to Covid.

The merge request is addressed, and we are back on main, (almost) ready for Wednesday. Yea.

A lot of work has been done with the research groups, but not much worth sharing for now. But I like fractional calculus, coloured noise, deterministic chaos and Operator Theory in dynamical systems!

I asked a question about the sense of an idea to Giorgio Parisi and he replied in 20 minutes saying "It may make sense, but it is not easy to find a way how to do that." It may make sense!
A Nobel prize said it may make sense!

Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (uh)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (what?)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (uh)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

See you next month.
