Usual meeting with Stefano: we sent some emails, discussed some ideas like somehow using Twitch. After that I uploaded a new episode of the Podcast.

Before lunch I talked with Andrea about my interest in Primo Venture and his experience with venture capitalists and angel investors, let's see, I definitely enjoy talking with him and bridging the gap between my heart and my mind.

In the afternoon I studied some works by Mezic and sent him our proposals for the works with Vishnu, Apeksha and Daniele, hoping to receive some guidance by him.
