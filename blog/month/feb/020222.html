# 02nd February 2022

I woke up early to join the 9am daily: everything kinda ready for the sprint review. Before that, I had to postpone again a podcast interview: I am not able to study his works! 

10.30am sprint review, I presented the work, kinda ok, even if we have still things to do on the open issues.

I didn't work much until lunch, then I helped Bram a bit. In the afternoon I worked for Aerisgate, at 7pm Francesco was happy with the setup and I have new things to do for next Wednesday.

6pm call with Benjamin, Ito's lemma is almost finished, we scheduled an extra call for Friday, hopefully next Wednesday evening we'll have the equations of motion down.

8pm call with Apeksha, really overwelmed by the formalism of Mezic and Giannakis, but we need to face it to get somewhere, I think.

At 10pm call with a student interested in learning more. Makes me feel younger :')
