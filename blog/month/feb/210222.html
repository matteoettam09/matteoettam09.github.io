The present writer is nothing of a philosopher, he has not understood the System, does not know whether it actually exists, whether it is completed;
already he has enough for his weak head in the thought of what a prodigious head everybody in our day must have, since everybody has
such a prodigious thought. Even though one were capable of converting the whole content of faith into the form of a concept, it does not follow that
one has adequately conceived faith and understands how one got into it, or how it got into one. The present writer is nothing of a philosopher; he is,
poetice et eleganter, an amateur writer who neither writes the System nor promises of the System, who neither subscribes to the System nor
ascribes anything to it.

He writes because for him it is a luxury which becomes the more agreeable and more evident, the fewer there are who
buy and read what he writes. He can easily foresee his fate in an age when passion has been obliterated in favor of learning, in an age when an author
who wants to have readers must take care to write in such a way that the book can easily be perused during the afternoon nap, and take care to
fashion his outward deportment in likeness to the picture of that polite young gardener in the advertisement sheet, who with hat in hand, and
with a good certificate from the place where he last served, recommends himself to the esteemed public. He foresees his fate–that he will be entirely
ignored.

I prostrate myself with the profoundest deference before every systematic "bag-peerer" at the custom house, protesting, "This is not the System, it
has nothing whatever to do with the System." I call down every blessing upon the System and upon the Danish shareholders in this omnibus–for a
tower it is hardly likely to become. I wish them all and sundry good luck and all

Respectfully,
