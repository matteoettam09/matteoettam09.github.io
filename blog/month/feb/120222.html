Today I worked like an asshole: a lot, and I am happy to have done so, but fuck I am tired an in some sense angry!

So I won't spend even more time writing down things, I did my job, and I am doing it by writing this line and not breaking the line.

So I am cursing fate but I still want to have a relationship with it. Which is probably a bad position.

So I guess I should put down my sword and play some chess before going to sleep.
