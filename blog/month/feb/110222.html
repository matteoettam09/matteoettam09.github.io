# 11th February 2022

Oh yea. I finished the refactoring. Also, Frazer had some news and therefore tomorrow I will be able to do something
about the godot dependency. Also, today I closed the issue with the repetition of initial condition when propagating
the uncertainty along a given trajectory. Things are coming to life.

After work, I met with Stefano: he did some work, which gave me the opportunity to properly work with git, VS code and Julia: new combination.

At 7pm I met with Joseph, really nice to meet again. He is happy to do something together, we initialized some stuff.
He is a smart guy.

After dinner, I had fun with Julia. I worked a couple of hours and I got [this beauty](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6898043512743370752/).
I love Julia.

Tomorrow last day of work before a couple of days of holiday!
