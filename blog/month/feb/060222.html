Woke up late and worked a bit for Benjamin, avoiding the combination of sympy and numpy. I arrived at the conclusion that there may be an error in Wikipedia, and that we need to take a look at the main reference book to see what we need to do in our case. Also, I figured that the second transformation is wrong but still linear, so the logic still holds, luckly.

I have then watched an interivew of Prigogine, brilliant, deep man: scientists embedded in a continental philosophy frameworks are much deeper than analytics ones. And their language is much sharper.

I had the vaccine, and while studying some works on Maliavin calculus, I started feeling sick. It's 7.30pm, I will have dinner and go to sleep. Fuck the pandemic.
