# 24th February 2022

I went back to work. I was not so productive: I think I am experiencing Covid fatigue. But beside this I am fine now.

Anxiety associated to the war is growing. I talked with many people, and with one person currently in Kiev: while he was explaining
the situation there were explosions near his place. Hopefully I can put some extra working hours in supporting them with satellite image processing.

Beside this, I had no dinner and spent the evening reading [GÃ¼nther Anders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnther_Anders).

I also shared [this recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKE1nIOrba4). Fuck war.
