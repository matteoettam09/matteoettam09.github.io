# 25th January 2022

Today I am tired, I am gonna fall asleep before 11pm.

I again missed the SDO Morning Coffee and jumpt straight into our daily. We discussed some aspects of covariance interpolation and how to make the associated routines less computationally intense. We also worked a bit with pre-commit. I have then worked a bit on a refactoring branch to clean up things. The CI/CD is now passing there, but long way ahead.

I also had a Technical Interview with [AIKO](https://www.aikospace.com/), interesting group of people, interesting work to be conducted and hopefully potential match with me, fingers crossed.

I have printed out my crash detection papers, but I was not able to start reading them.

I have met with the AstroKoopman group, last time we meet all together, from next week we start with two related but different projects, I spent the evening collecting the literature for the new front, together with getting some literature in preparation of Friday's interview.

Finally, I have applied for a position in [Space Dys](http://www.spacedys.com/).

Gonna get some rest now, all the best.
