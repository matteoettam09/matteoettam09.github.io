# 17th January 2022

This morning I missed the SDO Morning Coffee because yesterday I worked until late. I woke up, had breakfast and joined the daily. It went fine, I also managed to chat with Gabor regarding the use of cmake for cpp dependencies in our project. Then headache, palpitations, abdominal cramps. I couldn't have lunch nor dinner and I spent the day laying down and waiting for it to leave me alone. To make things more spicy, I had a panic attack around 5pm and I fell asleep. I therefore missed the call with Vahid and came back to life just before our crypto call, in which I was really out of shape.

I am now in bed with no hunger, but feeling weak, with a pain on my chest and not ready to tackle tomorrow.

Fuck it. This pandemic is killing me. [Let me at least dwell on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAN1abvye7Q).

p.s. if San Francesco could welcome death singing[Vita Seconda di san Francesco d'Assisi: di Tommaso da Celano](https://www.ofsliguria.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Vita-Seconda-di-san-Francesco-TdC.pdf)), I can at least avoid cursing tonight. 

p.p.s. and not cursing, I managed to correctly fork and add some modifications to [this website template](https://github.com/le4ker/personal-jekyll-theme). Not that I repent signing for the euthanasia referendum in Italy, but I understand that the destruction of absolutes is problematic: the absolute being that I can punch life back from "every" situation.
