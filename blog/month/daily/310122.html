# 30th January 2022

I am sleepy, I have to send the equations to Benjamin. And fuck I will, it's 11.26pm, see you in a while.

12.52am: I didn't make it, but kinda. How the hell do you implement the inner product between a Matrix and a 3d tensor in scipy!?

But yea, today I worked a lot, merge requests, CI/CD and stuff. 

Then meeting with Vahid and then with crypto. This life is gonna kill me: I don't think I will last more than 60 years like this. Lol.
