# 26th January 2022

Nice day today: we started with the daily and after some work on the pre-commit, also with Volker, and the approval of a merge request, we jumpt straight into the implementation of the interpolation outside GODOT. We implement some extra functionalitites, like making use of the knowledge of the symmetry of the covariance matrix, using a variable number of interpolation states. We got confirmation that the full 6x6 matrix is necessary, because not only high-velocity conjunctions should be considered.

At 6pm I met with Benjamin, the intuition I had a few days back was correct, and the derivations, documentation and implementation are now running smoothly. I will need to push a bit more before he can properly join me, but it's going to be really fun afterwards. I think we can aim at Nature and I have my reasons to believe so: 

- Jackques Lasquar published there a similar work, and our would talk with it;
- Giorgio Parisi got his Nobel prize on similar ideas;
- We talk about an important event in celestial mechanics still not well understood, proposing a causal model for it.

At 7pm I met with Aerisgate, the proposed architecture was approved, so I can now start building the infrastructure for the work in the weeks to follow.

At 8pm I have a quick crypto call, nothing fancy.

After dinner I studied a couple of works by Sornette (ETH) and by Gidea. I can smell my prey. The question at this point is: can speculation in the financial market be ethical? Am I playing in a zero sum game? I would argue that I am not, and that I am simply trying to play better then others in a game in which we are all prepared to lose interacting with an external environment. But let's say I am trying to play and win in a zero-sum game here: the fruits of this victory will not be used for pleasure, but invested in research and development in my field, so I think it is ethical to willingly kill a few people to save much more. I think about the [Trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) in the following way: let us assume that by virtue of studying we were to discover to what extent the solar system is stable, and how to best destroy this level of stability, making the Earth collapse into the Sun, killing every known living thing. It may seem that already putting ourselves in the position to have so much power is wrong, but I would argue that there are already forces acting agnosticly with respect to the survival of conciousness, so we might as well get to their level of power and have a chance of fighting back, while risking blowing ourselves up in the process. And what about climate change? What about [Gunter Anders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnther_Anders)? What about the acceptance of the everlasting dualism between a rationalized universe and an uknown one, always capable of destroying the system? The speed at which we rationalize things doesn't say anything about the nature of existance. 

I would say the answer is in always being process-oriented: do things with balance, with love, with harmony, even deadly sacrifices, and orient yourself to the highest goal you can conceive, letting it judge and elevate you. There is nothing but this, and this includes the unknown which is in some sense not here yet.
