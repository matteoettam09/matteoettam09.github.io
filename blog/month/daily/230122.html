# 23rd January 2022

It's 1am and tomorrow is Monday, good. But really good day today.

I kicked of review the paper we are submitting at [CNSNS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/communications-in-nonlinear-science-and-numerical-simulation), it's a nice work. I will need to record a presentation describing it, as usual. I will do that in the coming weeks. I have then met for the first time with someone from [Primo Ventures](https://www.primo.vc/): I work in space, finance, software, they work in space, finance, software, what are we waiting for? Next Sunday another meeting with them, let's see.

I have then worked a couple of hours for Aerisgate, nothing fancy for now, but necessary work nevertheless, I think.

I have then shared a new episode of the podcast [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNMXXgoKXSM&t=132s).

Before dinner I kept reorganizing my literature on financial crashes, I think I will print some of these in the coming days.

After dinner I worked on the paper with Benjamin: I couldn't put down the equations, but I was able to understand how to move forward and hopefully communicate it to him. If this does not work, I will go back to ground zero when we meet again.

Finally, I have worked on my website! Hello world, we are back online.

Cheers.
