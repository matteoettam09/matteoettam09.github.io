I am destroyed.

Today we worked on the interpolation: Lagrange sucks, and we needed to normalize the domain in order for it to be stable. At least now we are getting better results than GODOT, and maybe even CORCOS.I looked into the Cholesky decomposition but we won't probably need it.

After work I met with a bachelor student that needs help with analytical mechanics and physics, I would like to help here but I don't know where to find time, maybe in the weekend, let's see.

At 6pm I met with Stefano, we are going with Julia, there is a nice ecosystem and we may also have identified the project to target for a possible pull request. Julia is also nice for UQ.

At 7pm I met with the cypto guys, we contacted Gidea, hoping to talk to him in the coming weeks.

At 8pm I met with Daniele, we had an idea today, we are going to contact Mezic for his feedback on it, but the literature seems to point in this direction

At 9pm I had scheduled two different meetings at the same time because I fucked up. Thanks to their patience we managed to get everything done.

Stanotte sfonno il letto.
