# 20th January 2022

Today, thanks to my potato, I came back to life. I missed the SDO CAP Stand-Up but I had the time to do some housekeeping before our daily. The daily went well, as the work I did yesterday on the setup is pointing towords the right direction. We struggled a lot with the gitlab-ci contents, in order to make the CI/CD work with GODOT, and Ruri was super helpful in the evening, at least in showing how the depth of what we are aiming at doing. Tomorrow I need to try I few things, but if GODOTpy works like it is now, our package should run as well! Fingers crossed.

At 6pm I met with Stefano, kickoff meeting for our new work: the question is once again"Python or Julia"? This time I am tempted to say Julia, but we'll see in the coming week.

At 7pm I met with the crypto guys: the market has been sucking the last few weeks, but we are getting more and more structured. If I finally manage to find some time to populate our Confluence, the others could come in on the technical aspects and we could also start appreciating the power of these group project softwares. Nevertheless the meeting went fine; I need to study Random Matrix Theory.

At 8pm I met with Andrei, he is really smart, a lot of technical questions already on point showing he is already able to think about the end goal. Also nice chat about life before dinner.

At 10pm I had a 2 hours call with Amos, some documentation, slides, literature, and discussions about our shared perspective.

Now I need to quickly go to sleep because tomorrow morning I have an extra call at 9.30am.

Cheers!
