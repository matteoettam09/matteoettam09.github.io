# 21st January 2022

Today was a good day. I woke up late because I slept poorly, but the daily went fine. I then had a lot of meetings with Ruri, Volker, Gabor and Steffen, and we arrived at a result (i.e., at work they can do with us and work that we can do). The conclusion is really positive for us, as we can stay higher and treat godot as any other dependency. In the late afternoon I documented some stuff, worked a bit again on the CI/CD.

I then worked a bit for Andrei, I really enjoyed thinking again about things I had seen promsing and not implemented yet in the data-driven dynamical systems community (and AI more in general). I foresee a nice software and a nice paper (not only one on the Journal of Open Source Software, but also a proper journal paper with some nice results). Time will tell, but I have a good feeling about Andrei.

I rearranged a bit my finance literature. Note to myself: the literature is already all out there, the point of having it locally is to read it to be able to organize it to be able to act on it. Ethics is about doing what is right, not just knowing what is right. Embodiment is key, also in research. About this, I would like to print out some more papers, I feel like the ones I read from paper stick better than pdfs.

Before dinner I worked with Bram, he is struggling with docker images, gitlab-ci, external dependencies: everything kinda seen months ago, so I am happy I can be helpful, to some extent, and learn something in the process, as he is dealing with some things which I have never seen.

Ok, I actually felt like I had accomplished more today..but it's ok, it's Friday!
Tomorrow alarm clock at 9.30am! Yeeea
