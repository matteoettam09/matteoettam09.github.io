# 24th January 2022

Today I started the day with the daily, we talked about the outcome of the meeting with flight dynamics and split the jobs: today I looked into the implementation of scipy interpolators for the interpolation of the state and of the covariance matrix history.

At 1pm I had a call with Amos and his contact, interesting stuff, we definitely lack some knowledge on hardcore finance!

In the afternoon, beside working, I wrote and submitted a reference letter for Vahid. Honouring thing to be able to do.

At 7pm we met with the crypto guys, talking about crash detection, let's see if we can survive in this bear market.

At 9pm I recorded an episode of the Stardust Podcast: Igor Mezic, episode online in a few days.
