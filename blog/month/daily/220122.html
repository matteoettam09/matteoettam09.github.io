# 22nd January 2022

Today I woke up and met with Stefano. As things are progressing well, we could think about some long-term things, good.

Beside that, I've actually spent the majority of the day studying the works of professor Igor Mezic. I am happy about the outcome, we'll really see this on Monday.

That's it, I am tired now, bye.
