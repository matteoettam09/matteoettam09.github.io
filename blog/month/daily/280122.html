# 28th January 2022

So, today I was really tired, I didn't accomplish much. I am temped to push a bit more now but now, let's rest a bit, I will do it tomorrow, without weaking up too early but not even too late. Let's push without loosing balance.

The daily went fine, then I met with Francesca and things were more or less fine there as well.

But after that I didn't work much, so I will need to work 4 hours this weekend, ok.

The good thing is in the afternoon I managed to prepare and record the interview with professor Kutz, it should be online in a few days.

Now it's 11.15pm, I am not super tired, so I will enjoy the evening, cheers!
