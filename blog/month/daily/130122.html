# 13th January 2022

Today the SDO Morning Coffee was really helpful, I managed to start coding at 9.30 right away, and I arrived at the daily meeting with something. Luckly performing the interpolation in the event definition in Python, going back down to the Block Data in our cpp class, works and, even if it's not efficient (quite the opposite), it does the trick. I then had a long meeting about what we should have done in the last month and a half, in term of unit tests, documentation, how to keep the project ordered: we (and I) really suck at this, no wonder they are not satisfied. But I have then spent some time refactoring things and I can see why it's important to keep things neat: software development diverges quickly to chaos without structure, self discipline, rules. If you cannot say it in 7-10 lines of code, you should create a new function. Makes sense, will do.

After work I have recorded an episode of the Stardust Podcast, interesting conversation, easy going guest, and nice chat after the recording. At 8 I met with Andrei, additional contract signed by him, new github repo, and he should know what to do for the next week. We are aiming for an open source package and an easy paper in the Journal of Open Source Software, let's see how this goes, it shouldn't take more than some weeks, he seems able to do this without much guidance.

At 9 we had the Crypto Meeting, exciting news, mostly because now that we are four with less stress we accomplish more, so the growth is quicker and now it is really sustainable!

In any case, "basta la salute e un paio di scarpe nuove".

It's midnight, tonight I am gonna break the bed, oh yea.
