# 9th January 2022

Today I had again breakfast with Stefano because we needed to submit some more emails. After that I worked a bit on my crypto bots and I concluded that the overclocking of the API is now solved.

After lunch I recorded [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieUdLvL4USM). I then talked with Amos about some "numbers" and things we want to do between now and Thursday, looking into other service providers (not hedge funds). Then I studied a bit (not much), but I was in the mood so I recorded to audiopapers, one from [Laskar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVpyeOVt-hs&t=28s) and one from [Parisi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE3MA1ROzkI).

After dinner I worked for Aerisgate, studying the existing libraries and opening some issues.
