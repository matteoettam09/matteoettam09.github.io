# 16th January 2022

Sunday is over, a new week is coming.

Today has been a working day, with the only advantage that I woke up late. I've cleaned up the CI for my new branch, and I've modified it to work with different time units. I have documented and refactored the develop branch, but I got stuck with the fact that GODOTPY is not building every part of GODOT, so there is no hope of installing the dependencies with pip and at the same time be able to build the so files from our cpp classes. No idea if they have an idea about how we should do this, but it looks impossible to me. In the meantime I will work more on the refactoring (even if this is painful, as the goal of the refactoring is to work starting from the final product in mind).

In the late afternoon I had a meeting with a person interested in my experience in Stardust-Reloaded. I hope resentment not to have informed what I said, but only love and clear judgment.

After dinner I have worked on my website, looking into jekyll themes, and adding some sections to it.

Have a nice week, cheers.
