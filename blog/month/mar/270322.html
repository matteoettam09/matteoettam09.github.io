A few years back I started thinking: "when you act at the limit of yourself everything is a low-hanging fruit".

Today Stefano proposed something that makes me think something related to "time", no to "space":

"When you act at the limit of yourself, all the things you are able and willing to do, are backlogs": you have already conquered them,
it's just a matter of pushing them at your level.
