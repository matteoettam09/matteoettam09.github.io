# 01st March 2022

Not much to say. The majority of the day went away getting ready for the sprint review.
Steffen is really strong, but I think I am getting better as well.

I am a bit lagging behind myself: I probably think and program too much and act to little.

In the evening I met with Daniele and Vahid, interesting stochastic processes to be reconstructed from data.
I am thinking that Reinforcement Learning could be useful in a context in which the stochastic differential equation is obtained.

Probably useful in a pair-trading scenario, but let's see. The challenge is as always about how to deal with non-stationary processes, like the
exponential volatility with time-dependent diffusion. Maybe Strogatz can help once again.
