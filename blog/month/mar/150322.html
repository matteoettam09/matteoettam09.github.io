# 15th March 2022

Caro diario, today I am really tired. I collapsed around 11am, after working.
I got back on track, stressed like hell, struggled and managed to work 9 hours plus two hours of meetings.
I am ready for tomorrow's sprint review, the root finding for collision avoidance is up and running.

Almost there. I am inside a sacrifice bubble, there is a cornfield on the other side, I will meet you there.
