Aaron is dead.
Wanderers in this crazy world, we have lost a mentor, a wise elder. Hackers for right, we are one down, we have lost one of our own.
Nurturers, carers, listeners, feeders, parents all, we have lost a child. Let us all weep.

I'll use the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) protocol, combined with [git](https://git-scm.com/), [ResearchRabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/), [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) to build
a free, open access, authoritative, updatable, criticizable, decentralized, immersive research system that will make taxpayers and researchers benefit in a number of ways, kicking editors in the
balls so hard that they will need to find a real job. Not only my results, but my retrobottega will be accessible.

Aaron Swartz lives.

Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
Just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
Just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
You'll carry on
