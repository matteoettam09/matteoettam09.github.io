Good evening baby. I am going to be a CEO soon, it seems.

This morning we had the sprint review, we are almost there. Cmon!

I came back to Milano, I worked on Aerisgate, I worked with Benjamin, I met with Francesco, I studied with Apeksha.
I am now, 00.14am, in a call with Stefano to work on chaos.

Cheers.
