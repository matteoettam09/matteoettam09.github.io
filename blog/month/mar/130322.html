# 13th March 2022

Here I am, sorry. I missed you. I've been talking and listening a lot. Thinking, not so much: that's why I need you.

I've just got back on track with ESA as well (it's Sunday 11pm, I worked 8 hours today). Things are moving, quickly.
I am judging reality a lot, but I am forcing myself to go with the flow as long as everything is ethical and legal.
It's for sure weird, coming from where I am coming from, but this doesn't mean it's necessarily wrong.

And let's say that somewhere what I am doing has its roots in hell: it is always true that "people claiming to fight
evil from the inside are already partner in crime" and "pure people are powerless, and therefore co-responsible of evil".

The issue is: can I go back into the system and fuck it without getting sick again? Let's see, now I am more powerful.

It is our time to shine, let's go big. If I don't risk, I will bring the grudge with me forever.

But let us stay methodology driven, principles drive the world, ideas, not rocks.
