Sprint review: I think it went fine. I am learning a lot, in the meantime, let's see if I am crazy or if Francesca thinks
there is something I can do here.

Didn't accomplish much, I spent a lot of time on the godot dependencies without cloning in our project, still not working.

In the evening I worked on the stochastic two-body problem. I think with Benjamin we should show that as well, it is a nice way of introducing people to what we are doing.

I am going to sleep at 10.30pm like a baby.
