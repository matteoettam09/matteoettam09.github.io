# 04th March 2022

Today I took a day off. I just cleaned up my schedule, my house, my mind.

In the evening I had some calls with Amos, Joseph, Mex, Gidea, Vishnu.

Then Vahid arrived in Bologna: really nice to let the bodies interact, together with the minds, for once!

Since I don't have much to say, I will put here old notes I had written  after reading an article last year about communism, religion and space exploration:

"This desire not to update one's own system of thoughts when something new arrives but to consider the new as something that must be
integrated into the totalizing ideological system that one already has is problematic.
Space exploration is not an excuse for not worrying about climate change or the limited resources on Earth.
No one engaged in space exploration says "let's run away because everything is lost here", many say "if we want to save conscience,
the threat of a nuclear winter, climate change and the impacts of near earth objects make the colonization of others celestial bodies urgent.".
A proof of this, for example, is that Elon Musk works in Tesla and Solar City, and for decades he has been talking about the transition
to renewable energies and more particularly the reduction of CO2 emissions. Elon Musk is in favor of some form of Carbon Tax
(see [here](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-xprize-carbon-removal-100-million-climate-change-contest/)).
Obviously the article is careful not to mention the threat of asteroids which, not being a social construct,
are not appropriate in the narrative of the article.
Space explorers are criticized because they do something other than...That which does not see that it is possible to act on different levels of reality also
is not able to conceive reality ordered on hierarchies of values that have implications on human action:
in fact it is precisely allowing oneself to live in different levels of complexity which allows us to solve great problems.
Space exploration has made it possible to de-duce cryosat missions towards the more experiential dimension,
a great ally for understanding and therefore fighting climate change, for example.

On the public / private debate in the space sector, it is important to recall the criticisms of the end of the Shuttle era by,
for example, Robert Zubrin, which somehow anticipated the emergence of private entities in space.
It is also important to remember that the former president of ASI Battiston (also former PD candidate, so left-winger)
sees the future of space exploration in the synergy between public and private.
Whether it is worse for the poor to contribute to space missions that do not interest them
or that humanity has not yet managed to harness even an iota of the energy produced by the Sun, is to be debated.
And if one is lucky enough to be able to think all the solar energy within one's conceptual horizon, that's a good sign.

I believe that space exploration calls into question the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, one of the premises of Marx's capital.
A Marxist might say: "Ah, perhaps Marx should be updated, perhaps he did not consider that not only would we be able to fly,
but we would go to other celestial bodies, we would mine asteroids, perhaps Marx should be put a little in perspective".
Much more often the Marxist says: "You see, Marx had also foreseen space exploration and
therefore the tendency of the rate of profit to fall is also applicable to the entire solar system and the entire universe."
It is Gramsci who, speaking of this, says "when the limit of the elastic resistance of the metal is reached,
the contradictions of the market economy will manifest themselves".
And I say: "When every frontier will no longer be crossable, if one does not die of hardship, man will die of boredom
(assuming that it is possible to conceive humanity to dominate the whole universe: the universe is already in perfect harmony with itself,
and man is part of it. I think of "The Last Question" by Asimov). When the contradictions of the market economy will manifest themselves,
it will not be the dawn of socialism, it will be the end of the human adventure.

The Marxists' critique of the idealists was "you turn the world upside down". You pretend that the world walks on the head,
because it is based on ideas rather than on matter, on history.
The Gospel: "the sabbath is for man, not man for the sabbath": the system, the abstraction, the model, must serve man, not man the model.
Hence, orthodox Marxists are idealists, in the derogatory sense of the term. They want the world to adapt to the system and not the system to the world.

Implicit egalitarian premise to the critique of "everyone is invited". The fact that everyone is invited does not mean that everyone can afford it,
and this is obviously not bad. Inequalities are not obviously problematic (I think of Nietzsche).

Bezos is criticized because he allows himself to face the problem of the limitation of energy resources on Earth
(and not of overpopulation and poverty, as the article says), but also the individual moves on different levels at the same time:
if you are hungry, but you have to work, you finish working. There are more urgent things that are less important and therefore can be sacrificed.
The idea of sacrifice is the basis of all this. And Christian mercy (Mt 12: 1-8) does not deny sacrifices,
but only those that are not voluntary acceptance of the human condition. The man is the lord of the sabbath.
