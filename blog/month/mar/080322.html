So if I could I'd wish it all away
If I thought tomorrow would take you away
You, my peace of mind, my all, my center
Just trying to hold on one more day
Damn my eyes!
Damn my eyes!
Damn my eyes if they should compromise the fulcrum
Wants and needs divide me then I might as well be gone

Sara' che sta roba non e' un'inculata che meta' basta...
