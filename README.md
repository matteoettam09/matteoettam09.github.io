# Matteo Manzi

Welcome to my website. I am Matteo, Flight Dynamics Software Engineer for the Space Debris Office of the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) and for [Aerisgate](http://aerisgate.com/). I am also a freelance researcher thanks to Vahid, Vishnu, Apeksha, Daniele, Benjamin, Andrei, and I am a [Cryptocurrency Algoritmic Trading Service Provider](crypto.md). 

You can check my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxkveBmMqeXPXLzFdsnA0bA) channel: I use it to share episodes of the Stardust Podcast, my Music, and audiopapers.

Please connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Matteomanzi09) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteomanzi00seinfeldwasright/) and consider supporting my work on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/astrorum_pulvis)!

One last thing: I use my [Blog](blog.md) to meditate at the end of the day. "Donâ€™t break the chain!"
