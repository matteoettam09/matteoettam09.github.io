## About

I am an aerospace engineer specialized in space flight, with a particular focus on uncertainty quantification and data-driven methods in
astrodynamics dynamical systems. 

I have a strong background in linear algebra, including the use of singularity-free coordinates, differential calculus, and analytical mechanics. I have developed a number of numerical methods for different problems, including regression and optimization, using different programming languages and interfaces and I have a background in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics, with a particular focus on Celestial Mechanics, and I am currently exploring functional analysis and Koopman Theory, and particularly its relations with ergodic theory. My work includes the use of chaos theory in interplanetary trajectory design, the modelling of stochastic processes for robust optimal control and the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques, like Neural Networks and Kernel Methods, for the reconstruction and linearization of dynamical systems. I have also worked on estimation routines for spacecraft collision avoidance and on robust asteroid deflection.

I have worked in multicultural and interdisciplinary teams, hosted by various institutions throughout Europe. I believe I am a conscientious, responsible, and curious worker.
